# Neural-Network-From-Scratch
Implemented a fully-connected neural network using numpy and basic python syntax. Tested it on benchmarks like the Titanic Survivors and Iris datasets.

#### Neural Network configuration ðŸ“š
- Fully connected, with configurable number of layers, activation function for each layer, multiple cost functions to choose from.
- Supports custom activation and cost function.
- Configurable weight range for initialization.

#### Neural Network training ðŸ“‰
- Configurable batch size, learning rate, regularization parameter and dropout rate.
- Uses batch gradient descend for backpropagation.

#### Benchmark tests ðŸ“Š
- Tested on the Titanic dataset with 85% on the test set. (check the jupyter notebook with the experiment [here](TitanicDatasetTest.ipynb))
- Tested on the Iris datases with 98% accuracy on the test set.
